    "# Experimenting with perturbation generation\n",
    "\n",
    "This workbook is for trying different rewrite strategies for prompts. \n",
    "\n",
    "To run this, you will need to set an environmental variable for the API key for your perturbation model. For instance, if you're using an OpenAI model, the environmental variable name should be \"OPENAI_KEY\". \n",
    "\n",
    "You can use any model that is supported by LiteLLM, but GPT-4 works well because it gives the prompts back in the correct format.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need the whole repo to run this because there are functions in the \"functions.py\" workbook that this code imports and calls. You will also need to install the packages in the requirements.txt file into your environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that, you don't need to touch the functions themselves -- you can just modify the prompt and the rephrase instructions."
